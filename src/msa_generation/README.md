# MSA Generation

In this notebook, you will find the code that we wrote to generate the MSAs from the `human_train.tsv` file and the `human.fasta` file to build our **training set**: `training_set.pkl`

The fully built training set can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LQsWhlHzIwj_lRylsT0WR001mFt7RyCc).
