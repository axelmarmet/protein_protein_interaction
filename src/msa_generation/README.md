# MSA Generation

In this notebook, you will find the code that we wrote to generate the MSAs used for training our models (`training_set.pkl`) thanks to the `human_train.tsv` and the `human.fasta` files.

The fully built training set can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LQsWhlHzIwj_lRylsT0WR001mFt7RyCc).
